Long-term contracts are a special category of contracts where the obligations of the contracting parties are spread over many years â€“ sometimes up to decades. While used in a range of different transactions, they are most famously used in lucrative supply contracts in primary resource industries such as coal mining, liquified natural gas, electricity, and nuclear power supply contracts.
