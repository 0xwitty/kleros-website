Alexis Zeballos is a law student at the National University of CÃ³rdoba in Argentina. Beyond his academic pursuits, he is a dedicated crypto enthusiast, sharing his expertise by teaching blockchain at various educational institutions and associations.

As a Fellow during the 6th batch of the Kleros fellowship, Alexis delved into the issue of access to justice in the metaverse through meticulous case analysis. He contemplated the potential solutions that Kleros could offer to address these challenges.

This research, conducted in Spanish, explores the concept of the Metaverse, a digital realm that seamlessly merges the physical and digital worlds through immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality. The study acknowledges the emergence of conflicts and legal uncertainties within this evolving space. It proposes that Kleros, a decentralized arbitration system, could offer solutions to address issues related to jurisdiction and access to justice. The central question posed by this research is how Kleros can effectively mitigate access to justice challenges within the Metaverse.
