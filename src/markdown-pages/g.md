New, challenging issues have arisen from the present technological-era within e-commerce disputes, specifically regarding establishing localization of the jurisdictions involved and laws. Contemporary trade involves a large amount of daily purchase-sales that brings a bigger flow of data and therefore, more difficulty in establishing locality.

Within Kleros, the attempt to localize the issues mentioned above can generate greater disadvantages for the speed that e-commerce requires. Hence, this research will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of delocalizing Kleros Justice as an alternative in the context of online international arbitration, in order to protect the effectiveness and validity of an arbitration agreement.
