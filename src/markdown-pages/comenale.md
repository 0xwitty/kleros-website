In the present work, a simple, non-exhaustive enumeration was carried out on some aspects to be considered in the previous stage and in the formation of an electronic contract (“contractware”), taking some mentions to consider and include in a Smart Contract and a Smart legal Contracts. Max Raskin holds it is “defined as the physical or digital instantiations of contract terms onto machines or other property involved in the performance of the contract.

By instantiation, we mean taking the terms of the agreement and either writing them into previously existing software or writing them into software that is connected in some way to a machine that implements the contract.” As it will be mentioned in this paper, one of the aspects that the parties must consider in the drafting of the contract (especially a smart contract or smart legal contract) is how to resolve any breach or damage that may arise from the obligation between the parties.
