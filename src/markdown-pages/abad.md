David C. Abad is a Spanish Architect who also holds a Masters degree in Conflict Management and Dispute Resolution from Loyola University of Andaluc√≠a, Spain. He is a member of the International Forum of Professional Mediators, and is interested in investigating how the blockchain can and should adapt the traditional mediation to the new era of dispute resolution.

During his participation in the Fellowship, David will research a decentralized method of vetting mediators, which should provide greater reliability and security to mediators selected in mediation or arbitration, giving greater guarantees to the parties in the process.
