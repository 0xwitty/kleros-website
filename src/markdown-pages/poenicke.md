Paul Poenicke is a trained philosopher, specializing in social epistemology and social-political philosophy. His interdisciplinary approach to philosophical problems was enhanced by an MA in philosophy from Virginia Tech, where he developed his understanding of philosophy of science and began research in experimental philosophy.

During his time in the Fellowship, Paul investigated the impact and prevention of biases in Kleros' jurors.
